    #The execution model maintains two critical registers:⎩514⎭
    #⎩515⎭
    #1. IP (Instruction Pointer): References the current position within the⎩516⎭
    #   threaded code array being interpreted. Since threaded words may invoke⎩517⎭
    #   other threaded words, IP must be preserved in a reentrant manner via⎩518⎭
    #   the return stack on each invocation.⎩519⎭
    #⎩520⎭
    #2. W (Word Pointer): References the CFA of the currently executing primitive.⎩521⎭
    #   This global register serves an analogous function to 'self' in object-oriented⎩522⎭
    #   languages, enabling subroutines to access word header fields through fixed⎩523⎭
    #   offsets from the CFA.⎩524⎭
    #⎩525⎭
    #Optimization rationale: W is positioned to reference the CFA rather than the⎩526⎭
    #word header base. This design eliminates offset arithmetic for CFA access—the⎩527⎭
    #most frequent header operation—at the cost of requiring offset adjustments⎩528⎭
    #for other header fields (NFA: W-2, flags: W-1, PFA: W+1). This represents a⎩529⎭
    #deliberate trade-off favoring the common case.⎩530⎭
    #⎩531⎭
    #The inner interpreter loop performs the following operations:⎩532⎭
    #- Fetch the next CFA from RAM[IP] into W (performing the first indirection)⎩533⎭
    #- Increment IP to advance through the threaded code array⎩534⎭
    #- Execute the primitive via RAM[W]() (performing the second indirection)⎩535⎭
    #⎩536⎭
    #By caching the dereferenced CFA in W, we amortize the cost of double⎩537⎭
    #indirection: both primitive execution and header field access within⎩538⎭
    #subroutines utilize the same cached reference, avoiding redundant⎩539⎭
    #dereferences. This is functionally equivalent to parameter passing in⎩540⎭
    #object-oriented method invocation, but eliminates the overhead of⎩541⎭
    #explicitly passing 'self' to each primitive.⎩542⎭
    #⎩543⎭
    #Note: W's state is only defined during primitive execution (within RAM[W]()).⎩544⎭
