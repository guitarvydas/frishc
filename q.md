Checking: I'm transmogrifying a meta-syntax to Python. I insert line number tokens, e.g. "⎩632⎭", as required. I want to skip over most of these as I parse and rewrite, but, I want to keep them so that the final stage can insert Python comments that map the transmogrified code back to the original source. This is *almost* like spaces, but I don't want them to ultimately disappear. Currently, I'm peppering the grammar with "line" matches in carefully selected places. I would be happier if I could just treat them as noise but keep them and re-emit them in the transmogrification pipeline. I'm wondering if I've missed some feature that lets me do this more simply than manually accounting for them in the grammar?
